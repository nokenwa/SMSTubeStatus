# SMS Tube Status
Thereâ€™s nothing worse than being stuck on the trains in London during rush hour when there are delays. Summer is wrapping up in London, but if you want to get a really cheap sauna experience, just head onto the Central Line during peak rush hours on a day when there are train delays. I know this because my miserable self has been trapped, sweltering on a tube with an armpit in my face, more times than I care to remember.

Using Azure functions, Twilio SMS Output Bindings and the handy Transport for London (TFL) API I can get a daily warning about the status of the tube lines I use to get to work every day.
